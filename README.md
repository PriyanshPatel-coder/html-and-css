# HTML and CSS Practice

This repository currently contains my practice code for HTML and CSS. I have learned to create and style various web elements using the files in this folder.

## What I have Learnt

- **HTML Structures**: Creating tables, forms with various input types (text, password, email, radio buttons), and linking pages.
- **CSS Styling**: Styling text, buttons, backgrounds, and creating specific components like navigation bars and dropdown menus.
- **Page Layout**: Structuring pages with headers, bodies, and semantic tags.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main practice file covering tables, forms, and basic styling.
- `dropdown.html`: Implementation of a dropdown menu.
- `page1.html` - `page5.html`: Additional practice pages.
- `style.css`, `navbar.css`, `dropdown.css`: CSS files for styling different components.
